            <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>
                I went to Southern Cayuga Central School. It's really small (my
                graduating class was only ~40 people) compared to the schools
                that other people in this class attended. Some of my hobbies are
                playing video games, listening to music, playing instruments
                (piano and alto saxophone), and coding occasionally although
                I've only ever made small projects.

            <img src="/images/pizza.jpeg" alt="pizza image" />
            <p>
                My favorite food is pizza. I have eaten it almost every day for
                dinner since this semester started mostly because it is close to
                my dorm.
