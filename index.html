        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>High School</h3>
        <p>
            I went to Southern Cayuga Central School. It's really small (my
            graduating class was only ~40 people) compared to the schools that
            other people in this class attended. Some of my hobbies are playing
            video games, listening to music, playing instruments (piano and alto
            saxophone), and coding occasionally althought I have never made a
            fully fledged project.
